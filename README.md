# PlantEuka ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ»

This repository is dedicated to the development of a comprehensive database of pangenome graphs, a vital tool for the precise identification of taxonomy from DNA samples. Planteuka leverages the power of aeDNA to bridge the gap between our present knowledge and the untold stories of plant evolution.
